## Introduction

**BlueKeep**, tracked as **CVE-2019-0708**, is a critical vulnerability in the **Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP)** service on older Windows versions. It was dubbed “wormable” due to its potential for **self-replicating exploits** — similar to WannaCry and NotPetya.

Discovered in 2019, the bug affects **Windows XP, 7, Server 2003, and Server 2008**.

## How BlueKeep Works

The vulnerability lies in the way the RDP service handles pre-authentication connections and session setup. A specially crafted RDP request causes a **heap buffer overflow**, allowing arbitrary code execution before login.

### Exploit Flow

1. Open RDP socket to vulnerable host
2. Send crafted `TS_TSharePDU` packets
3. Trigger memory corruption
4. Execute shellcode remotely as `SYSTEM`

## Risks and Consequences

- **No login required**
- **Full SYSTEM access**
- **Potential for worm behavior**
- **Millions of exposed machines at disclosure**

## Patches and Mitigation

- Microsoft released patches for:
  - Windows XP (custom update)
  - Windows 7, 2003, 2008
- Disable RDP if unused
- Enable **Network Level Authentication (NLA)**
- Block TCP port 3389 at network perimeter

## Detection

Monitor for:

- Unauthenticated RDP attempts
- Unusual heap memory usage
- IDS/IPS alerts on RDP buffers

## Conclusion

BlueKeep was a **ticking time bomb** that fortunately saw less widespread damage than feared. Still, it served as a wake-up call for unpatched legacy systems.

> If it’s not being used, **disable RDP**. If it is, **harden it**.
