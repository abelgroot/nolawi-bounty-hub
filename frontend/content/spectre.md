## Introduction

In early 2018, researchers revealed two groundbreaking vulnerabilities in modern processors: **Spectre** and **Meltdown**. Unlike traditional software bugs, these attacks exploited hardware features—specifically **speculative execution** and **cache timing**—to steal sensitive data from protected memory.

## Spectre vs. Meltdown

| Feature        | Spectre                         | Meltdown                       |
|----------------|----------------------------------|--------------------------------|
| CVEs           | CVE-2017-5753, CVE-2017-5715    | CVE-2017-5754                  |
| Affects        | Intel, AMD, ARM                 | Primarily Intel CPUs           |
| Exploits       | Branch prediction               | Out-of-order execution         |
| Attack Type    | Side-channel timing attack      | Memory access bypass           |
| Fixable via    | Microcode, compiler barriers    | Kernel page table isolation    |

## How They Work

### Spectre

1. Trains the CPU branch predictor
2. Mistrains to access out-of-bounds memory
3. Leaks data using cache side channels

### Meltdown

1. Exploits privilege flaw in Intel CPUs
2. Accesses kernel memory from user space
3. Reads forbidden data via side channel

## Impact

- Affects nearly **every modern CPU since 1995**
- Forces major redesigns of OS kernels and hypervisors
- Causes **performance degradation** in patched systems

## Mitigation Strategies

- **Apply CPU microcode updates**
- Use **Kernel Page Table Isolation (KPTI)**
- Compile software with **Retpoline** to mitigate Spectre
- Employ cache flushing or speculative barriers in sensitive code

## Conclusion

Spectre and Meltdown redefined the threat model in cybersecurity. No longer is software alone to blame—**hardware itself** can harbor critical flaws.

> Security now starts at the transistor level.
