## Introduction

**ProxyShell** refers to a group of three chained vulnerabilities in Microsoft Exchange Server, disclosed in 2021 and heavily exploited in the wild. They allow **unauthenticated remote code execution** and **mailbox access** on vulnerable servers.

These bugs were presented at Black Hat and later weaponized by ransomware groups and APTs.

## CVEs in the Chain

- **CVE-2021-34473**: Pre-auth path confusion
- **CVE-2021-34523**: Privilege escalation
- **CVE-2021-31207**: Arbitrary file write

## How It Works

1. Exploit URL rewriting bug to access internal endpoints
2. Abuse `Autodiscover` and `PowerShell` endpoints
3. Gain SYSTEM privileges by writing web shells (e.g. `proxylogon.aspx`)

## Real-World Exploitation

- Ransomware gangs like LockFile and Conti
- China-based Hafnium APT group
- Massive scanning and exploitation surge in Q3 2021

## Detection

- Look for `.aspx` shells in Exchange folders
- Abnormal use of `powershell.exe` under IIS processes
- EDR alerts for webshell commands or Outlook service abuse

## Mitigation

- Apply **Exchange Server cumulative updates**
- Block external access to `/powershell` and legacy endpoints
- Monitor and rotate admin credentials

## Conclusion

ProxyShell shows how chaining multiple low-complexity bugs leads to high-impact RCE. Legacy protocols in Exchange should be **disabled** unless explicitly needed.

> One patch too late, and your mail server becomes an attacker's beachhead.
