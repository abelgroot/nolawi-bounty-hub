## Introduction

Nolawi Bounty Hub is a web application that allows **whitehat hackers** and **bounty hunters** to find and apply for bounties (security projects) posted by companies. Companies can post bounties, manage applications, and collaborate with ethical hackers to secure their platforms.

The main purpose of this project is to provide a platform for Ethiopian and African companies that have no way of finding or accessing the expertise of whitehat hackers and bounty hunters. Many companies in these regions lack the resources to secure their digital platforms, making them vulnerable to cyberattacks. Nolawi Bounty Hub bridges this gap by connecting companies with skilled ethical hackers who can help improve their security posture.

This project was developed as part of the ALX Portfolio Project.
